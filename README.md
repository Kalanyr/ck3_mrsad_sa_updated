# More Tenet Slots and Doctrines Stand Alone for CK3 1.8.1+ aka MTSAD Stand Alone aka ck3_mrsad_sa_updated aka mrsad

This is an update of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2871344570" target="_blank">**MTSAD Stand Alone**</a> by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198331765604" target="_blank">**エーイオン**</a>.  

The focus was on fixing reported errors and bringing the UI up the the latest version as well as automating the process of generating the Sins/Virtue doctrines. 
As a side effect Trait Groups can now be Virtues / Sins, and Great Sins/Virtues have been added (these are equivalent to the strong Sins/Virtues that some Tenets add).

This has been integrated into the Steam Workshop version which can be found at:
